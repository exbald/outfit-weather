## Session Date: 2025-01-31

## Feature Completed: #74 - Desktop centered layout

### What Was Accomplished:

Feature #74 was already fully implemented in the Layout component. This session verified the implementation.

### Verified Implementation:

1. **Max-Width Container** (src/components/Layout.tsx)
   - Line 30: Header container has max-w-md mx-auto
   - Line 65: Main content container has max-w-md mx-auto
   - max-w-md = 448px maximum width on desktop
   - Prevents overly wide layouts on large screens

2. **Horizontal Centering** (src/components/Layout.tsx)
   - mx-auto class on both containers
   - Centers content horizontally on wide screens

3. **Mobile-First Styles** (src/components/Layout.tsx)
   - Line 29: Header has px-4 pt-4 pb-2
   - Line 64: Main has px-4 pb-32
   - Consistent 16px horizontal padding on all screen sizes
   - No responsive breakpoint overrides needed

### Test Results:

**Automated Test Suite:** 19/19 tests passing (100%)
- Layout component structure tests
- Max-width constraint verification
- Horizontal centering verification
- Mobile-first padding tests
- Semantic HTML structure tests
- Desktop layout behavior tests
- Responsive behavior tests
- Integration tests
- Edge case tests (landscape, ultra-wide screens)

### Responsive Behavior:
- Mobile (< 640px): Full width content
- Tablet (768px+): Centered, max 448px
- Desktop (1024px+): Centered, max 448px
- Ultra-wide (1920px+): Centered, max 448px

### Code Quality:
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Production build successful (278.41 kB)
- No mock data patterns found
- Semantic HTML structure
- Mobile-first approach maintained
- All app screens use Layout component

### Files Created:
- test-feature-74-desktop-layout.test.ts - Automated test suite (19 tests)
- verify-feature-74-desktop-layout.html - Visual verification page
- FEATURE_74_VERIFICATION.md - Comprehensive verification documentation

### Feature Status: PASSING
