## Feature Completed: #28 - Swipe-up Gesture Expands Drawer

### What Was Accomplished:

1. **Implemented Touch Gesture Recognition** (`src/components/Drawer.tsx`)
   - Added touch event listeners (onTouchStart, onTouchMove, onTouchEnd)
   - Track swipe distance and velocity with thresholds
   - Direction-specific behavior: swipe-up to expand, swipe-down to collapse
   - Visual drag feedback with transform during gesture

2. **Gesture Recognition Logic:**
   - **Distance Threshold:** 50px minimum to trigger expand/collapse
   - **Velocity Threshold:** 0.5 px/ms (fast swipes work at shorter distances)
   - **Maximum Drag Offset:** 300px (prevents drawer from being dragged off-screen)
   - Direction checks prevent incorrect behavior (can't expand by swiping down)

3. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Real-time `transform: translateY()` during drag for smooth visual feedback
   - Drag offset updates immediately as user swipes
   - Drawer springs back if threshold not met
   - Smooth CSS transition for final expand/collapse animation

4. **Testing:**
   - ✅ Created comprehensive test suite (test-swipe-gestures.js)
   - ✅ All 9 gesture logic tests pass
   - ✅ All 6 drag offset tests pass
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
   - ✅ Production build successful (bundle: 210.88 kB)
   - ✅ Click and keyboard interaction preserved (accessibility)

### Code Quality:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Proper event handler typing (TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>)
- ✅ Refs properly typed (useRef<number>, useRef<HTMLDivElement>)
- ✅ Well-documented constants with comments
- ✅ Build passes: `npm run build`
- ✅ No accessibility regressions (aria-label updates, keyboard still works)

### Feature Status: ✅ PASSING

Feature #28 has been marked as passing.

**Verification Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Add touch event listeners
2. ✅ Track swipe distance and velocity
3. ✅ Expand drawer on upward swipe
4. ✅ Collapse drawer on downward swipe (when expanded)
5. ✅ Visual feedback during drag
6. ✅ Distance threshold (50px) works
7. ✅ Velocity threshold (0.5 px/ms) works
8. ✅ Direction-specific behavior verified
9. ✅ Click/keyboard still work
